# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Mathematical model of the morphogenesis checkpoint in budding yeast.**

**Abstract:**   
The morphogenesis checkpoint in budding yeast delays progression through the
cell cycle in response to stimuli that prevent bud formation. Central to the
checkpoint mechanism is Swe1 kinase: normally inactive, its activation halts
cell cycle progression in G2. We propose a molecular network for Swe1 control,
based on published observations of budding yeast and analogous control signals
in fission yeast. The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-
dependent kinase regulation, converted into a set of differential equations
and studied by numerical simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the
phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other predictions, the model
attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase known to play a role in Swe1
degradation: Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of
Swe1 activity. The model supports the idea that the morphogenesis checkpoint,
like other checkpoints, raises the cell size threshold for progression from
one phase of the cell cycle to the next.

The model reproduces Fig 3 of the paper.
